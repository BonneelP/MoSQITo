## Roughness calculation (Daniel and Weber)

### Introduction

The acoustic roughness calculation hasn't been standardized yet. 

In MoSQITo, the code is based on the algorithm described in *Psychoacoustical roughness: implementation of an optimized model* published in Acustica by P.Daniel and R.Weber in 1997.
The roughness model consists of a parallel processing structure that is made up of successive stages and calculates intermediate specific roughnesses R_spec, which are summed up to determine the total roughness R.
A step by step description of how to use MoSQITo to calculate the roughness from a .wav file is given in tutorial nÂ°...

### Validation of the implementation

The article validation procedure is based on a comparison with the results by H.Fastl and E.Zwicker in *Psychoacoustics*, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1990. 


Note : all the plots can be obtained by runing the following command in the main MoSQITo folder: 

```python -m pytest mosqito -m roughness_dw```
