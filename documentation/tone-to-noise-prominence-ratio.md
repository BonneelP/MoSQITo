## Tone-to-noise ratio (TNR) and Prominence ratio (PR) according to ECMA 74

### Introduction

The acoustic tonality metrics calculation was introduced in the ECMA 74. The calculation is based upon the comparison between each tonal candidate and the surrounding spectrum. 
2 different methods are implemented to detect the potential tonal components.

### Validation of the implementation

The standard doesn't include a validation procedure.
